# Visualizing_YouTube_Trend

## 1. Introduction
From the start of a video sharing platform, YouTube in 2005, YouTube has been a constantly growing platform and become the world's largest video sharing platform. All the way from cooking courses to courses on how to start learning code, there are tons of video contents that people from all over the world become content creator and also become content user. In this trend, it has become crucial for us, as data scientists, to analyze what contents users watch, whether there are gaps between most watched contents and most produced contents, is there any relationship between number of likes in a single video and number of comments in it, and what are the characteristics of videos that have tons of comments and likes count per views. In this project we will look through, analyze, and visualize YouTube data shared at Kaggle called "Trending YouTube Video Statistics".
